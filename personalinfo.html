<p>
I possess a Diploma of Childrenâ€™s Services and a Bachelor of Education and Care (The Early Years) which I acquired through University of Tasmania. I have worked in child care and early years education for over a decade which has been personally rewarding. I have completed some courses related to computing as liberal subjects at university as well as in secondary school. I am undertaking an Information Technology degree in order to undertake a new career path which also feels like a return to my younger self.
I have been married since 2016 and have two children. I enjoy music as a hobby and I enjoy playing guitar primarily, but also mandolin and keyboard as secondary instruments.
