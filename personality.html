I feel that these tests have a degree of accuracy about me as a person although they are imperfect. My learning test is one I feel some scepticism on; this is because as far as listening goes, I tend to have trouble holding attention and I feel I will learn by doing. I am however, quite a visual learner and like things not just verbally explained but shown. I recently built a rack for my old CDs and in order to get an idea of how to go about building it I watched some YouTube videos in order to get an idea. The Big Five and Myers-Briggs tests I feel are more accurate and give a general overview of my personality. What these mean to me is that I am generally a more introverted person, who values harmony and dislikes conflict. If I make a mistake I am usually dedicated to improving myself on whatever area that may be. Assertiveness does not come naturally for me but I can be more assertive if I have time to think situations over more and work out what is fair and what is not. There have been situations where I have asserted myself or even been highly aggressive (these were moments I believe there was genuine need to be aggressive).

I am always dedicated and always happy to help and do my part in a team environment as best as I can- this will be one of the more positive aspects of my personality with regard to working at a team. Being able to direct and lead others in something I can do with beginners particularly in certain areas but I am not usually willing to “take charge” and be the boss that tells everyone what to do. I am open to new ideas and if I am a new member to a work environment I will normally try to adapt to the system that is in place before asserting my own agenda. If I sense that there is a problem then I may say so but in a gentle and positive way if possible; I am not too down the line and blunt. Sometimes, this can be a weakness.

<p>
I believe I should attempt to form a team where everyone has an equal say and that there is “even ground” in terms of status of authority. If there is a need for someone to have the final say I would generally prefer not to be that person. I believe I should focus on what my professional strengths are and utilise those more often while allowing others with different strengths to focus on their areas more. To use an example I will give a context from my child care work- I am good with music and story telling and so I should do that more often. Whereas if a colleague is more suited to doing craft, I will let them do it more often. This doesn’t mean I shouldn’t try other areas- especially as  I like to improve areas I struggle in. I will try to be kind and supportive to other team members as possible, but may have to think about how to say things if the need for being assertive arrives.
