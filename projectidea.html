<h1>My Project Idea</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Having been a hobbyist musician for 21 years, primarily a guitar play, I decided to create my idea based on this passion. My idea is to create an app for smartphones or tablets that can be used to record the playing of an instrument or vocal humming, that could be then converted to MIDI format. Having done some research there are pre-existing apps that can achieve this, mainly through using a piano or a “recognised instrument”. <i>Kodai</i> is an app I have been recently looking into and briefly experimenting with. What <i>Kodai</i> offerers is recording to wav, and then converting to MIDI. There is a MIDI editor that can be used to make adjustments. <i>Kodai</i> also offers the ability to collaborate with other users. What I would like my project to have is the ability to be able to recognise more or less any kind of voice through pitch recognition and then, after being converted to MIDI, can then be played back in a different voice- so that a recorded guitar, for example could then be played as a saxophone. The user could then play recordings back while making new recordings which can then be multi-tracked. A user could make a musical composition with many instruments or voices, by using just one instrument to record.

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
For me personally, recording can be fun, yet tedious. When I play my instruments and come up with compositions that I like I sometimes take simple means- such as using my phone to record it quickly for the purpose of remembering it and showing a friend whom I send it to via a messaging app. This app that I would like to design would be simple to use, with an intuitive interface and also fun to use. This app would be intended for fun, but also practical in that musicians can get creative ideas down on the go for further work later as well as get their ideas down so that they can share them with their musical colleagues. For example, if I were to create a guitar riff that I liked, I could record it but also record a complimentary riff as a second track which I could change to a synthesiser sound and send to the keyboard player in my band to give them an idea.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The interface of my project would have a number of different “screens” for different components of the program. The first screen would be a main menu screen with a “Projects” button and an “Audio” button. The “Audio” button is where the user’s exported files can be accessed- after a user has completed a Midi project to their satisfaction, they can then export them to audio files such as wav or mp3. From the screen the audio files can be shared to social media services such as Facebook and Soundcloud.
</p>

<p>
The “Projects” button would open a screen that lists the users “projects”, there would be a “create project” button for the user to tap. When there are existing projects in this list, the user can long-tap any of these projects which will bring up a menu that displays options including “delete”, “export”, “share”. From here, the MIDI files can be shared, as well as exported to an audio format as mentioned above.
</p>

<p>
When a project is created or selected, the screen displays a list of the tracks in that project. There will be some playback-control (play, pause and a time bar) buttons at the bottom of the screen that remain fixed in that position, including when the user scrolls down their list of tracks. The tempo (in beats per minute) can also be altered here. The tracks can be long-tapped to bring up a menu to duplicate them, delete them, change the colour they appear on the screen as, or change the name of them. Through long-tapping, the user can also open up a small window in the middle of the screen to quickly change the track voice (instrument sound), add effects or alter the volume of the selected track as well as pan the track between left and right stereo channels. There will be a button to create new tracks, as well as a button to open up a “mixer”, the mixer will open up a new screen where the user can have control volume and stereo panning of all tracks, they can do this while the MIDI file is playing and the playback controls will be visible at the bottom of the screen in the same way that the open track screen has.
</p>

<p>
When a track in selected, this will open the screen that enables the user to record themselves playing an instrument or humming, as well as have a simple MIDI editor where the user can view the notes being played, change or delete notes (there length or the note played). A piece of music can be made using the MIDI editor without the user doing so through recording if they wish. Effects such as chorus, flanger, phaser, delay, reverb, overdrive and distortion can be added here, a pop-up window can be opened for the user to alter the settings of these effects.
</p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

<p>
The hardware would involve a smartphone or tablet, and be designed to use the integrated microphone of the device while also having the capability to use an external connected microphone or a connected midi controller.
</p>

<p>
The software will need to be designed to recognise pitch and be able to accurately convert what is “heard” through the phone microphone to notes in a MIDI file. Creators may need to experiment with whether it will work better to have pitch-recognition of <i>any</i> being inputted or if instead the software will need to be programmed to recognise a number of different instruments. Because the software will allow the user to create multitrack recordings, the user will be able to record a new track while <i>listening</i> to the tracks already recorded, this could be challenging to achieve through programming given that if the user is playing back and recording simultaneously through the phone, the microphone may pick up the audio being played back. A work around may be to pre-program the software to ignore the playback during recording or users could be encouraged to listen through headphones. The program will enable open source editing- particularly an ability for new instrument voices to be added. This may include instruments voices that allow the user to alter- for example, a synthesiser voice where the user can change various properties such as oscillation and filters.
</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>

<p>
This project will require programmers who have an understanding or music and basic music production software. Programmers who are skilled with artificial intelligence will also be required. Programmers will need to use audio equipment in order to experiment with audio capture in order to find the best ways to enable to program to achieve this as best as possible.
</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>
If successful, this project will enable musicians to create and experiment with their music on the go while also enabling them to develop better ideas for how to craft their music for producing their music later. Users will be able to capture their ideas beyond just a simple microphone recording. This project will be a potential tool for electronic music artists to create, by inputting with one instrument and converting that to a variety of sounds.
