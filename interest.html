<h1>Interest in IT</h1>

<p>
My interest in IT began when I was very young- perhaps 3 or 4 years of age. This was in the 1980s when my family did not yet own a computer. My father however, who was a Mathematics teacher, would occasionally borrow them for short amounts of time. These were BBC Micro computers, these were my earliest experiences of computing, computer games, and IT in general. My father said it was these computers that enabled me to gain an interest in learning the alphabet. Much later, in 1997, when my family owned a computer for the first time, this took my interest to a new level. During this time I also had an older student in my home group at high school who was strongly interested in computers and we would discuss them together. I studied some subjects related to IT during my secondary schooling as as well as some in my first year of university when studying education. These included but were not limited to programming.
I came to RMIT because I needed to find a more sustainable employment path than what I am currently on. I currently work in child care and although I have enjoyed it and found it personally rewarding it is time for a change. After much thinking, an IT path seemed to make sense based on my interests in the past and also a re-emerging interest at the present. In one sense, I am returning to my younger self while also moving forward. I went to the Open Universities website to see what I could find and came across this one offered by RMIT.
I expect to deepen my understanding of the role and impact of IT in the world from these studies. I also expect to develop and extend skills learnt in the the past- especially with regard to programming. I would also like to learn more about networks, as I feel this is not a strong area for me. I would like to develop and deepen my awareness of ethical issues surrounding IT in hopes that this will guide my judgment and professional conduct in future employment.
